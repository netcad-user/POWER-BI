**Project Description**
AtliQ Hardware has experienced notable growth recently and has decided to leverage Power BI for advanced data analytics. This initiative aims to provide stakeholders with insights across key areas, enabling strategic and data-driven decision-making.

The company distributes computers and accessories through three primary channels: retailers, direct sales, and distributors. However, a recent setback occurred with the unexpected losses from opening a new store in America. These losses were identified through surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis. Recognizing the competitive advantage that rivals gain from advanced analytics teams, AtliQ Hardware has acknowledged the urgent need to establish its own analytics team. This move is essential for generating actionable insights and maintaining a competitive edge in the industry.
